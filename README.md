# Reading_List
This application allows users to search for and save books of interest. The Google Books API is used to get books matching the user's query. This is a full-stack MERN application i.e. it has been built using MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React and Node. The application is deployed to Heroku. The MongoDB Database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

# Usage

On the Search page, type your query into the search box. 10 books related to your query (as determined by the Google Books API) will be displayed. Click the Save button to save a book to your 'Saved' reading list.
